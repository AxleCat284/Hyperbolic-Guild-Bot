#### Basic Setup

1. Install all the requirements with the console command `yarn`
2. Go to config.json and edit everything, its very simple so you should be fine.
3. Go to `./src/music/config.js` and edit stuff there
4. In console, run `node .`, if everything is fine you should see "Minecraft connected to %username%, Discord connected to %bot name%, music connected too %bot 2 name%"
5. its done! put it in a decent 24/7 hosting server and it shound run fine(please note that FFMPEG the music manager is annoying sometimes so there is a chance music may not work.)

#### **Development Setup**

1. Clone to reposity on gitup
2. Use github desktop to make a local repo of it (easier for pull requests)
3. Install requirements and deal with both configs
4. Go to most discord commands and edit the footer out from my name/my guild's name to your guild.
5. go to index.js and delete the big chunk of text that says HYPERBOLIC
6. Either start making changes (addings or removing features) or start the bot as-is

Remember! If you make any changes to the bot (adding features not removing) open a pull request on the main repo so I can view them! anyone who adds features will be added to the command /credits and to the README!
